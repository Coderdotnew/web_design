# Business Startup Landing Page
It is easier today than ever to start an online business. Many billion dollar companies have been started by young people who have had nothing more than a bit of programming skills, a computer, and access to the internet. Once the idea forms, most companies do several things:
1. Determine what the company does
2. Decide on a name
3. Build a landing page

## What is a Landing Page?
A langing page is a simple, creative, informative page that informs users what is to come. Often times the landing page comes months or years before the company is ready to launch. Landing pages might include the following:
- The company name
- A design or logo
- Colorful theme
- Top navbar or footer (or both) that include informative links (it's okay if these links don't even work!)
- Text form for the user to input their email and receive updates
- Description of the company!

# The Project
Think of a company you would like to see exist! It can be anything or do anything (even if you don't think it's possible yet). Your job as the front-end web developer is to get a landing page up that will attract users and keep them coming back. Try to incorporate as much information about the company as you can:
- What is the name of the company?
- What does it do?
- When is it going to be released?
- And more...

Here are a few famous examples of landing pages
