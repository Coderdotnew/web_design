# Web Design with HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript
- Each week you will meet with your instructor and a class of fellow soon-to-be software engineers to code the day away.
- During each session, you will learn new syntax, rules, tips, tricks, and nuances about the topic we are currently reviewing. 
- The majority of the session is devoted to coding. 
- Working primarily in pairs, known as pair-programming, you will be able to collaborate, problem solve, discuss, and grow as a student, thinker, teammate, and programmer.
- You will have access to the curriculum 24/7, stored on a private Github repository.
- This course was purposely written to provide you with more code challenges than you could handle while in class, so don't worry if you don't get through them each day, or even by the end of the semester. This is hopefully just the start of your coding journey and you will continue to have access to these code challenges after the course is complete to continue completing and refactoring your code.
- Feel free to email your instructor at any time of the day or night. We encourage you to continue coding outside of class and if you find yourself struggling with a challenge, don't hesitate to shoot an email! 

# Coder.new Culture  
### 1. Embrace a culture of collaboration  
This course is meant to be collaborative. Come with an open mind ready to commit to learning each day, not only from your instructors but also from your peers. 
### 2. Embrace a culture of failure  
Imagine a world where apps didn't crash, where there were no bugs in our computers, and where everything worked perfectly (or where Snapchat didn't regularly update their filters). Well that sounds pretty awful considering there would be no need for engineers to create and fix them! It is our job to fix code and make things work beautifully.  

Be prepared to constantly receive errors messages. Failure in computer programming is a positive thing and a hint to the answer (and Ruby gives us some pretty great error messages).   
### 3. Embrace a culture of not knowing   
The more you learn in this course, the more you will realize you don't know. Be ready to ask questions, be asked questions, oh, and *definitely* be ready to use our good friend Google.
